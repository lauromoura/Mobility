The documentation was generated with Qt 4.7 from git and QtMobility 1.2.0
in a Ubuntu 10.10 laptop. The following modules failed to build correctly:

- Messaging - Missing dependencies
- Bearer - Only available with Qt 4.6.

To generate docs for them, we manually copied the headers to the include
directory. This was enought for Messaging but Bearer needed some hacks
in doc/CMakeLists.txt and global.h. The CMake changes were minor ones and
can be integrated in mainline. The global.h changes are harmful and are
available as a patch that should be applied when generating the docs.
